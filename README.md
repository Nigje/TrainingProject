# C# courses (2017)

I like to teach what I have learned (it is hard and very time consuming). One of the misconceptions I have seen in companies is that co-workers keep their knowledge as a secure key and do not share it with others (always to increase their power). This is awful and the source of this bad practice is the culture of the company. I prefer to be a role, not a key person, and to achieve this I tried to share my knowledge with others. Sometimes knowledge sharing has included discussing technology and business, writing the extra documents for projects, holding a course for beginners, or holding a workshop for senior engineers.
The repository is part of a course I held in 2017 for mid-level developers (I'm going to delete it).

Topics:
